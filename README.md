Summary
-------

Artisan is a software that helps coffee roasters record, analyze, and control roast profiles. When used in conjunction with a thermocouple data logger or a proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller), this software can automate the creation of roasting metrics to help make decisions that influence the final coffee flavor.

Artisan is listed on [Awesome Python Applications](https://github.com/mahmoud/awesome-python-applications).

Donations
---------

This software is open-source and absolutely free to use, also in commercial settings.

> *Home roasting enthusiasts often donate 10-100.- (in $ or EUR), while small roasting businesses and consultant that use Artisan in their daily work tend to donate 100-300.- (in $ or EUR). For extra tech support, please inquire.*
